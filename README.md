<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## Preview

..

<br>

This is a video player/editor application based on GUI application in Qt, targeting a range of users, from professional videographers to casual users.
As an User Interface module's coursework, this project is collabolated with Ayesha Rahman: sc21ar@leeds.ac.uk, Tom Morton: sc21tam@leeds.ac.uk, and Natalie Leung: sc21nl@leeds.ac.uk.

Project timeline: 18.November.2022 - 16.December.2022

## Iterations

### 1) Design Layout

Prototype: Created the initial layout focusing on the main UI and wireframe. Basic structure established, influenced by similar apps like CapCut and VLC.
Key Features: Logo screen fades to show projects with existing edited videos. Initial layout lacked full functionality but allowed users to check timelines and export edited videos.
Feedback: A questionnaire was distributed to users of other video editing apps, gathering 50 responses to refine usability.

### 2) Adding Features

Prototype: Revised the UI based on user feedback. Added separate buttons for text editing, filters, and stickers for easier access.
Key Features: Removed the combined effects button and improved wireframe for better usability. Users can now scroll through projects using touch gestures.
Feedback: Adjustments made to enhance accessibility and user-friendliness based on continued user input.

### 3) Screen Colouring and Final Refinemen

Prototype: Finalized the user interface, removing unnecessary elements and enhancing visibility with a black background and white text.
Key Features: Implemented a highlight function for active buttons (e.g., undo) and ensured clear visibility for user actions.
Feedback: Conducted interviews to gather final impressions. Users expressed satisfaction with the simplistic and effective design and features.
